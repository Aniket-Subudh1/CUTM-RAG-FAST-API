analyze problems related to aptitude test and logical analysis are important to the students in this
course. They are also made to address a group of individuals and interact with them in the form of
group discussions. The topics for these group discussions include both technical and non-technical
matters.
a) A pool of professional electives is made available by each department facilitating the students to
opt for the courses of their choice. These electives are designed to impart advanced knowledge in
various specializations in any branch of engineering targeting employability, higher education and
entrepreneurship. These electives enable the students to obtain proficiency in a particular stream in
their branch of engineering / technology in addition to the strong foundation through the core
subjects which are mandatory.
b) A further step taken by the university is introduction of project based / skill based electives. The
objective of this is to impart pre-placement training and proficiency in project handling and skills
required in their future careers.
c) On grounds similar to professional electives, a basket of courses with management background
are made available for the students to select from that are relevant to their discipline thus molding a
professional student equipped with managerial capabilities.
d) In programmes other than engineering, a similar procedure of academic flexibility is implemented
through extending the facility of choosing subjects from a pool of free / professional electives. In
undergraduate / post graduate programmes in basic & applied sciences, the students are offered
certain courses with computational backgrounds (Courses from Computer Science discipline).

Students access to health-care information and education services:
The University has students of different age groups. The unique blend of the age groups
necessitates greater attention on Students. The university recognises the vulnerability of this age
group; while on one hand they need professional/technical education, on the other hand there is a
necessity to make them aware of health and well-being, focussing on safe sexual practises. To this
end the University conducts regular awareness programmes for students and staff. A failed
relationship or a stress related to academics can thwart both mental and physical development of
students can lead to several other cascading negative effects like use of narcotics or psychotropic
substances. In order to address these issues, the university has established counselling centre in
its main campuses. The university is also committed to abide with the Articles 21 and 19(1) of the
Constitution of India which delineates Protection of Life and Personal Liberty and Right to Privacy.
Utmost privacy and confidentiality is maintained in all services provided to students and staff.

INDIAN SYSTEM OF MEDICINE SUSTAINABLE APPROACH :
Indian System of Medicine is very popular worldwide. Considering the importance, Government of
India has taken several steps and with its Ministerial approach, establishing AYUSH Department
covering all the branches including Ayurveda, Siddha, Homeopathy, Unani, Yoga and Naturopathy,
& Tibet Medicine.
Rather than using a term alternative, Indian System of Medicines is an apt word and a direct choice
of health and wellbeing especially for a preventive health. As these schools focus on Diet, Lifestyle
Modification and Preventive Health and then focus on curative aspect and link towards sustainable
approach aligning with Good Health and Wellbeing (SDG 3) directly. Also, a focused approach of
utilizing the resources may conjoin with Decent Work & Economic Growth (SDG 8) and
Responsible Consumption & Production (SDG 12) changing the concept of Lenear economy (Take,
Make and Dispose) to Circular Economy (Renew, Remake and Share).

course. That being said, as far as jobs are concerned, there are plenty and they are significantly
well paying. Engineers of all kinds are in high demand at the moment, but at the same time only the
best of the best get recruited given tightness of budgets and limitation of companies that are hiring.
Recruiting agencies include coal and oil companies, colleges and universities, other mining
companies, manufacturing industries, and etcetera.
Mining Engineering graduates are often recruited as mine safety managers or assistant managers,
and therefore it is beneficial to have adept managerial skills. Apart from that a candidate may be
required to lead teams or communicate with clients, making communication skills also crucial.

assists physicians and cardiologists in diagnosing medical conditions in patients. An ECG
technician, also called as cardiographic technician, uses electrocardiogram machines to run
diagnostic tests to measure a patient’s heart rate, monitor cardiac rhythm.
ECG technicians have, as their most basic qualities, aptitude for working with machines and
interest in making people healthy. They must also be logical, precise and protective of confidential
medical information. Beyond these, the most crucial skills for those who work as ECG technicians,
according to Cheryl Passanisi, author of “Electrocardiography Essentials,” are communication
skills, both written and verbal. ECG technicians must communicate clearly and concisely with
patients, doctors and other medical staff. They must also know the appropriate medical terminology
to explain information accurately to patients.

Plant breeding has been practiced for thousands of years. However, advanced technologies such
as next-generation sequencing (NGS), usage of JMP software in genome interrogations, genome
editing using CRISPR, allele mining, multi-genic approach in growth and development are
revolutionizing this practice. Hence, the breeder’s investments on the technologies based genetic
crop improvement within limited timeline is appreciable. Companies like Bayer (Germany),
Syngenta (Switzerland) and DuPont (US) depend on combinations of both molecular and
conventional breeding to develop various crop seeds for novel traits. With the estimated market of
plant breeding and CRISPR plants to grow and reach USD 14.6 billion by 2023, the public and
private sectors are interested to fund towards the application and development part of
high-throughput sequencing systems, marker-assisted breeding and genomic selection in the field
to drive the program over the next five years. Our course is designed to support and upskill the
students to work in the areas of agriculture, molecular breeding and healthcare sectors. Science
graduates from Centurion meet industrial partners (Syngenta and Kaveri Seeds Co.) and research
partners (NRRI and IIRR) expectations to be well-versed with advanced techniques involved in the
field of crop improvement through genome-wide association studies.

these programs take foundational classes in communication theory and research, but learn these

there are some programs that focus more on mass communication research, media criticism, and
the impact of media on social issues.
As the field of communication expands and advances with the introduction of new communication
technologies, the fields of mass communication, journalism, and digital media have played
increasing roles in the dissemination of information about culture and society, politics, the economy,
and health. Professionals who engage with these forms of communication have the power to impact
society through clear, ethical, and informative messaging that can reach local, state, national, and
